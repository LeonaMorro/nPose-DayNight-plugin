# nPose DayNight plugin
This example shows you how to register and use an user defined permission.  
If you put this script into your nPose build, you will be able to use the permission `day`, which is true during the SL day and false during the SL night.

Example:  
`SET:Poses:reading{day}`  
`SET:Poses:sleeping{!day}`

this will enable the button "reading" during the SL day and the button "sleeping" during the SL night

Have fun
